# PRD 29: Guides to Skills Migration

**Status:** Ready | **Created:** 2026-03-07 | **Updated:** 2026-03-07

## 1. Background

RA-H completed a full guides-to-skills migration (2026-03-07). The migration:
- Renamed all "guide" surfaces to "skills" (service, tools, API, MCP, UI)
- Consolidated 7 operational guides into 1 `db-operations` skill
- Added 8 curated system skills with clear trigger/contract/success-criteria structure
- Dropped immutability (all skills editable/deletable)
- Kept backward compatibility via guide service aliases

Latent Space Hub still uses the old "guides" system with 6 bundled markdown files. We need to do the same migration, but adapted for LS Hub's context: this is a **public-facing knowledge base**, not a personal tool. The skills here serve two audiences:

1. **MCP agent skills** — operational procedures the bot/agent reads during execution (search policy, graph operations, content types)
2. **User-facing guides** — learning content humans browse in the UI (agent engineering, context engineering, onboarding)

### What exists today

**Bundled guides** (`src/config/guides/`):
| Guide | Purpose | Keep? |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `welcome.md` | Onboarding — what is LS Hub, where to start | Yes — refine |
| `agent-engineering.md` | Curated learning path on building AI agents | Yes — refine |
| `context-engineering.md` | Curated learning path on context/memory management | Yes — refine |
| `mcp-quickstart.md` | 2-minute MCP setup for Claude Code/Cursor | Yes — refine |
| `bots.md` | Slop bot documentation | Yes — refine |
| `categories.md` | 8 content categories reference | Yes — merge into welcome or drop |

**MCP standalone guides** (`apps/mcp-server-standalone/guides/system/`):
| Guide | Purpose | Keep? |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `start-here.md` | DB operations startup | Merge into `db-operations` skill |
| `schema.md` | Database schema reference | Merge into `db-operations` skill |
| `search.md` | Search tool docs | Merge into `db-operations` skill |
| `content-types.md` | Content types reference | Merge into `db-operations` skill |
| `member-profiles.md` | Member profile system | Merge into `db-operations` skill |

**Service layer:** `src/services/guides/guideService.ts` — filesystem-based, readonly mode support, uses `gray-matter` for frontmatter parsing.

**UI:** `GuidesPane.tsx` (sidebar browser) + `GuidesViewer.tsx` (settings editor).

**Tools:** `src/tools/guides/` — listGuides, readGuide, writeGuide.

**API:** `app/api/guides/` — GET list, GET/PUT/DELETE by name.

**MCP:** `ls_list_guides`, `ls_read_guide`, `ls_write_guide`, `ls_delete_guide`.

## 2. Decisions

### What skills should exist

**System skills** (bundled, agent-facing — following RA-H's refined structure):

| Skill | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `db-operations` | **New** — consolidate 5 MCP standalone guides | Core graph read/write policy. Search before create, description standards, edge rules, dimension governance. |
| `curation` | **New** | Content quality standards, entity extraction rules, dedup policy, metadata expectations. |

**User-facing guides** (bundled, human-readable — displayed in UI):

| Guide | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `welcome` | Refine existing | What is LS Hub, the 8 categories, how to explore, where to start. Absorb `categories.md` content. |
| `agent-engineering` | Refine existing | Curated learning path through agent design fundamentals and frontiers. |
| `context-engineering` | Refine existing | Learning path on context/memory management for AI systems. |
| `mcp-quickstart` | Refine existing | 2-minute setup guide for connecting MCP to Claude Code/Cursor. |
| `slop` | Refine `bots.md` | Slop bot — what it does, how to interact, how it works. Rename from `bots.md` since Sig is deprecated. |

### Architecture decisions

1. **Rename everything from "guides" to "skills"** — service, tools, API routes, MCP tools, UI labels, pane types
2. **Two skill categories:**
   - `system/` — agent-facing operational skills (db-operations, curation)
   - `guides/` — user-facing learning content (welcome, agent-engineering, etc.)
3. **No immutability enforcement** — matches RA-H's final decision. All skills editable.
4. **No consolidation of user guides** — they're learning paths, not overlapping policy docs
5. **Consolidate MCP standalone guides** — 5 operational guides → 1 `db-operations` skill (matching RA-H pattern)
6. **User skills:** max 10 custom skills allowed
7. **Backward compatibility** — guide service becomes a stub delegating to skill service, old API routes delegate, old MCP tool names still work
8. **Readonly mode** — in production (Vercel), use bundled skills only, no filesystem writes
9. **Skill frontmatter structure** (matching RA-H):
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: DB Operations
   description: "Core graph read/write policy."
   when_to_use: "Any graph read/write operation."
   when_not_to_use: "Pure conversation."
   success_criteria: "Writes are explicit and correct."
   ---
   ```

### UI: Guides visible to users

Add a **read-only guides section** in the UI where users can browse the user-facing guides (welcome, agent-engineering, context-engineering, mcp-quickstart, slop). This replaces the current GuidesPane.

- Users can read but not edit system guides
- Clean markdown rendering with the existing styling
- No settings/editor UI for system guides
- The settings panel (`SkillsSettings`) only shows user-created custom skills

## 3. Implementation

### Part 1: Skill Service Layer

**Create:** `src/services/skills/skillService.ts`

Port from RA-H's `skillService.ts` with LS adaptations:
- `listSkills()` → `SkillMeta[]` (name, description, category: 'system' | 'guide' | 'user')
- `readSkill(name)` → `Skill | null`
- `writeSkill(name, content)` → writes to user skills dir, max 10 enforced
- `deleteSkill(name)` → deletes user skills only

Storage:
- System skills: `src/config/skills/system/` (bundled, checked in)
- User guides: `src/config/skills/guides/` (bundled, checked in)
- User skills: `~/.latent-space-hub/skills/` (runtime, local only)
- Readonly mode: bundled only, no filesystem

Legacy redirect map:
```typescript
const LEGACY_REDIRECTS: Record<string, string> = {
  'start-here': 'db-operations',
  'schema': 'db-operations',
  'search': 'db-operations',
  'content-types': 'db-operations',
  'member-profiles': 'db-operations',
  'bots': 'slop',
};
```

**Modify:** `src/services/guides/guideService.ts` — convert to stub:
```typescript
export { listSkills as listGuides, readSkill as readGuide, writeSkill as writeGuide } from '../skills/skillService';
```

### Part 2: Skill Content

**Create:** `src/config/skills/system/`
- `db-operations.md` — consolidate the 5 MCP standalone guides (start-here, schema, search, content-types, member-profiles) into one comprehensive graph operations skill. Follow RA-H's structure: core rules, search-before-create, description standards, edge conventions, dimension policy.
- `curation.md` — content quality standards, entity extraction expectations, dedup rules, metadata requirements.

**Create:** `src/config/skills/guides/`
- Move + refine existing guides:
  - `welcome.md` — absorb `categories.md` content, tighten
  - `agent-engineering.md` — refine to match RA-H's cleaner skill structure
  - `context-engineering.md` — same
  - `mcp-quickstart.md` — same
  - `slop.md` — rename from `bots.md`, update for Slop-only

**Delete:** `src/config/guides/` directory (after migration)

**Update:** `apps/mcp-server-standalone/`
- Move `guides/system/` → `skills/system/`
- Replace 5 individual files with single `db-operations.md`
- Add `curation.md`
- Update custom skills path from `guides/custom/` to `skills/custom/`

### Part 3: Skill Tools

**Create:** `src/tools/skills/`
- `listSkills.ts` — wraps `listSkills()`
- `readSkill.ts` — wraps `readSkill(name)`
- `writeSkill.ts` — wraps `writeSkill(name, content)`, broadcasts `skills:updated`
- `deleteSkill.ts` — wraps `deleteSkill(name)`

**Modify:** `src/tools/guides/*.ts` — delegate to skill equivalents

### Part 4: API Routes

**Create:** `app/api/skills/route.ts` — GET list
**Create:** `app/api/skills/[name]/route.ts` — GET read, PUT update, DELETE delete

**Modify:** `app/api/guides/route.ts` — delegate to skills
**Modify:** `app/api/guides/[name]/route.ts` — delegate to skills

### Part 5: UI

**Create:** `src/components/panes/SkillsPane.tsx`
- Two sections: "Guides" (user-facing learning content) and "Skills" (operational + user-created)
- Click any skill/guide to read full content (markdown rendered)
- Read-only for system skills and guides
- Edit/delete buttons only for user-created skills
- "New Skill" button (max 10 user skills)
- Event listener on `skills:updated`

**Create:** `src/components/settings/SkillsSettings.tsx`
- Settings panel for managing user-created skills only
- Create, edit, delete custom skills
- System skills listed but not editable
- Replaces `GuidesViewer.tsx` in settings modal

**Modify:** `src/components/panes/types.ts`
- Rename pane type: `'guides'` → `'skills'`
- Update `PANE_LABELS`, `DEFAULT_SLOT_B`

**Modify:** `src/components/layout/LeftToolbar.tsx`
- Update icon mapping and label: `skills: FileText`, label `'Skills'`

**Modify:** `src/components/layout/ThreePanelLayout.tsx`
- Update pane type references from `guides` to `skills`
- Import `SkillsPane` instead of `GuidesPane`

**Modify:** `src/components/settings/SettingsModal.tsx`
- Replace `GuidesViewer` tab with `SkillsSettings`

### Part 6: MCP Server Updates

**Modify:** `apps/mcp-server-standalone/index.js`
- Rename functions: `listGuides` → `listSkills`, `readGuideFile` → `readSkillFile`, etc.
- Rename tools: `ls_list_guides` → `ls_list_skills`, `ls_read_guide` → `ls_read_skill`, etc.
- Keep old tool names as aliases for backward compatibility
- Update `ls_get_context` to return `skills` field
- Move file paths from `guides/` to `skills/`

**Modify:** `app/api/[transport]/route.ts`
- Add `ls_list_skills`, `ls_read_skill` tools
- Keep `ls_list_guides`, `ls_read_guide` as aliases

### Part 7: Documentation + Cleanup

**Modify:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — update directory listing, mention skills not guides
- `docs/contributing.md` — update references
- `docs/architecture.md` — update if it mentions guides

**Delete after migration:**
- `src/config/guides/` (replaced by `src/config/skills/`)
- `src/components/panes/GuidesPane.tsx` (replaced by `SkillsPane.tsx`)
- `src/components/settings/GuidesViewer.tsx` (replaced by `SkillsSettings.tsx`)
- `apps/mcp-server-standalone/guides/` (replaced by `skills/`)

## COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-03-07
**What was delivered:** Full guides-to-skills migration. Created skill service layer (system/guide/user categories), 2 system skills (db-operations consolidating 5 MCP guides, curation), 5 refined user-facing guides. SkillsPane replaces GuidesPane with categorized sections. SkillsSettings replaces GuidesViewer. MCP standalone and HTTP servers updated with ls_list_skills/ls_read_skill tools plus backward-compatible ls_list_guides/ls_read_guide aliases. Guide service converted to stub delegating to skills. Old guide files retained for backward compat, new skills directory is the source of truth.
